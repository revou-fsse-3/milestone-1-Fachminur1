# Welcome to my project for RevoU assignment. 

## In this assignment, I am creating a website that consist of HTML, CSS, and JS file. The structure is build like this : 
- Header
  - Navigation bar

- Main
  - Banner
  - Information Section
  - Product Section
  - Sign up section

- Footer
  - Company information section

**Here are the steps of creating them from scratch:**

## Building website from scratch by using HTML, CSS.

**1. Build the structure in HTML.**
> The first step is building the structure in HTML. This step important because the HTML is the core of this assignment. This is done by using VSCode to create the content of the website. The use of semantic HTML is also required.

**2. Create styling in CSS.**
>    After the creation of the core is completed, it is important to use styling in the CSS so people could use the website properly. There are several things need to be applied in CSS for this assignment, such as:
>>  *. Transition and animation.
    *. The use of grid.
    *. The use of object fit on images
